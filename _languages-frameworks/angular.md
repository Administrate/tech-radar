# What is it ?
Angular is a platform that makes it easy to build applications with the web. Angular combines declarative templates, dependency injection, end to end tooling, and integrated best practices to solve development challenges. Angular empowers developers to build applications that live on the web, mobile, or the desktop.

# Why ?
When setting up your initial Angular development environment using the Angular CLI, you will realize how much the CLI has now become essential.

This is because we need so much more setup today when compared to what we had before - and this is the case not only for Angular but also for any other equivalent ecosystem.
