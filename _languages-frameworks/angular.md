# What is it ?
Angular is a component-based framework for building scalable web applications.

# Why ?
Angular was introduced at Administrate back in 2013, at the time it was the leading frontend framework for building dynamic web applications. As the usage of Angular was never invested in beyond Version 1, we decided to make the switch to using React as our primary fronted framework.

# History
## 2019
With tms-ux and piston-ux using React gaining traction. Angular should be dropped and not used for any future projects.

## 2013
Angular (v1) used as the frontend for Python based webservices (reports & core)
