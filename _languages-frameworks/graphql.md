# What is it ?
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data.

# Why ?
Advantages of GraphQL:
- Single endpoint - only one endpoint to query data across multiple data sources
- Prevents over-fetching of data - client can specify the exact types and fields they need
- Simple versioning - strongly opinionated to be a living API, allows deprecation of fields and addition of new fields
- Documentation - Types and fields are documented in the schema 
- Tooling and ecosystem - Many tools have been made for monitoring and scaling GraphQL APIs

Challenges
- Performance - HTTP Caching layers cannot be used, need to provide caching and performance improvements at a lower level

# History
## 2017
GraphQL API ported from Java to Python 3 (to avoid proliferation of languages)

## 2016
GraphQL API started as one API to rule them all (originally using Java) https://github.com/Administrate/moribund/tree/trunk/phoenix
