# What is it ?
Flask is a python library for developing web applications based on Werkzeug and Jinja2. It is intentionally lightweight and extensible.

# Why ?
Widely used and battle tested with simple support for testing, cookies and debugging.  It is much more lightweight than alternatives like Django, and hence can give better performance.

Alternatives like FastAPI and Starlette may be considered for future projects, but for now this is the defacto choice for python applications at Administrate.

# History
## 2012
Flask adopted as web framework on intial Python web applications at Administrate
