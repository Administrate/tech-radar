# What is it ?
Previous version of [Python](/tech-radar/langauges-frameworks/python3.html) that is now end-of-life.

# Why ?
Python 3 was released in in 2008 with significant changes that did not have full backwards compatibility. Administrate have been slow to fully migrate to Python 2, but now only have one production service (reports) running using the older version.

# History
## 2020
Python 2 sunsetted. Python 2 should not be used for future projects and all active codebases should have plans or strategies to migrate to Python 3

## 2012
Python adopted at Administrate. Strategic decision as was much easier to hire skilled engineers with Python rather than PHP experience
