# What is it ?
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class.

# Why ?
With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community.

# History
## 2019
