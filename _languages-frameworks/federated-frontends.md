# What is it ?
Multiple separate builds should form a single application. These separate builds should not have dependencies between each other, so they can be developed and deployed individually.
This is often known as Micro-Frontends, but is not limited to that.

# Why ?
Allows our teams to own and deploy their frontends independently from other teams, even when elements may be used in the same page in the users browser.

# History
## 2022
WIth introduction of tribes owning product areas. Federated Frontends would give us a path to decompose our React UI codebases into smaller tribe-owned microfrontends.
