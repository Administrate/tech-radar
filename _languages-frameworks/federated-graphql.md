# What is it ?
GraphQL Federation is an architecture that helps you create a unified supergraph GraphQL API that combines multiple smaller GraphQL APIs.

# Why ?
Decomposing our GraphQL monolith into smaller services and federating them into a single Graph would allow us to maintain a single API endpoint and Graph for all our services while allowing our individual teams to own the microservices in their product region.

# History
## 2022
With introduction of tribes owning product areas. Federated GraphQL would give us a path to decompose our monolithic API into smaller tribe-owned microservices.
