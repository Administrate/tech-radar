# What is it ?
TypeScript is a programming lanauge that builds on JavaScript, adding optional static typing, classes and interfaces.

# Why ?
TypeScript has all the benefits of JavaScript which it can be compiled to, so can run anywhere JavaScript runs

But also adds benefits:
- better integration with IDEs that helps catch errors earlier
- improves readability through additional syntax to make intent of code more obvious

In addition to this it gives benefits when used with frameworks like React (e.g. Easier definition of Prop Types, better JSX support)

# History
