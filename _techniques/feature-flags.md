# What is it ?
Feature Flags (also known as Toggles or Dark Launching) is a technique to allow development teams to modify application behaviour without modifying application code. This technique can be useful when it is advantageous to include features within a release without those features being immediately available in the application upon release. 

# Why ?
Separating the deployment of features from their availability helps to avoid release pipelines and environments becoming congested with features that have passed QA but have not yet been granted sign off.
