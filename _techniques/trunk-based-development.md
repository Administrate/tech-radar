# What is it ?
Trunk-based development is a version control management practice where developers merge small, frequent updates to a core “trunk” or main branch. Since it streamlines merging and integration phases, it helps achieve CI/CD and increases software delivery and organizational performance.

# Why ?
Allows continuous code integration, not long lived feature branches that need to be continually rebased on mainline changes.
Encourages small batch size for changes, the use of feature flags, and comprehensive automated testing.
