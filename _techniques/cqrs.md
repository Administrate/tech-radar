# What is it ?
Command Query Responsibility Segregation is a pattern where you use a different model to update information than you use to read information. This separation can be valuable, but can lead to extra complexity in the system.

# Why ?
Separating write behavior from read behavior, which the essence of the CQRS architectural pattern, provides stability and scalability to enterprise applications while also improving overall performance.
