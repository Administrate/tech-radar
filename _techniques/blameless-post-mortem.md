# What is it ?
An incident postmortem brings stakeholders together to take a deeper look at an incident and figure out what happened, why it happened, how the team responded, and what can be done to prevent repeat incidents and improve future responses.

Blameless postmortems do all this without blaming teams or individuals, but identifying learnings that can be applied to improve processes and systems.

# Why ?
In a blameless postmortem, itâ€™s assumed that every team and employee acted with the best intentions based on the information they had at the time. Instead of identifying and admonishing whoever screwed up.

This approach helps:
- foster an open, always improving culture of learning #always-improving
- decrease the chances of ignoring incidents for fear of blame #transparency
