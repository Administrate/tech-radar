# What is it ?
Microservices - also known as the microservice architecture - is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of services that are:
- Highly maintainable and testable
- Loosely coupled
- Independently deployable
- Organized around business capabilities
- Owned by a small team

# Why ?
The microservice architecture enables the quick, frequent and reliable delivery of large, complex applications, by decomposing the system into a set of smaller, simpler, independently deployable services.
