# What is it ?
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a technique for building software that guides software development by writing tests. In essence you follow three simple steps repeatedly:
- Write a test for the next bit of functionality you want to add.
- Write the functional code until the test passes.
- Refactor both new and old code to make it well structured.

# Why ?
Most obviously it's a way to get good test coverage, since you can only write some functional code in response to making a test pass. The second benefit is that thinking about the test first forces you to think about the interface to the code first. This focus on interface and how you use a class helps you separate interface from implementation.
