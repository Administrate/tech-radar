# What is it ?

Github Actions is a continuous integration & delivery platform that helps development teams build, test, and release code and automate their operations.

# When ?

As of November 1st, we have a working POC in a twin idp project, we will plan to adopt GH Actions
in the IDP first, and then migrate all throughout November 2022 and into early December our entire
platform of services.

By the end of Q4 2022 nothing will use CircleCI, our in house deployment dashboard, or AWS CodePipelines.
