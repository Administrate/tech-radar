# What is it ?

Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced /vit/, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects. It consists of a dev server that provides rich feature enhancements over native ES modules and a build command that bundles code with Rollup, pre-configured to output highly optimized static assets for production.

# Why ?

The JavaScript community seems to have landed on Vite as the build tool of choice, meaning that it has good documentation and examples.
