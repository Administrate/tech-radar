> 📝 **NOTE**: Before we consider trialing this we need proof that the tech industry has reached a consensus that this tool is safe from a copy-left licensing point of view. Currently there is too much consternation around it's usage to be deemed safe.  

# What is it ?

GitHub Copilot uses the OpenAI Codex to suggest code and entire functions in real-time, right from your editor.

# Why ?

In GitHub's own words:

> Spend less time creating boilerplate and repetitive code patterns, and more time on what matters: building great software. Write a comment describing the logic you want and GitHub Copilot will immediately suggest code to implement the solution.

GitHub's blog post (linked below) claims significant improvements in developer productivity, satisfaction and energy levels. In one of the experiments, those using Copilot to write a JavaScript server completed the task in half the time of those who did not use Copilot.

There is a chance that Copilot represents a significant disruption to the software engineering industry in which case we should adopt it as early as possible to remain competitive.
